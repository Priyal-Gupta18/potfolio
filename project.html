        <p>
            The automatic door opening systems are used in commercial buildings, shopping malls,
                theatres, etc. These systems are used to open the door when a person comes near to the
                entrance of the door and closes it after he moves away from the door or after entering
                into the door.

       <h3>Student Grading System:</h3>
        <p>
            A grading system is a method of evaluating a child's educational performance solely on
                the basis of points. It will reduce the number of students who are misclassified based on
                their grades. A Grading System allows users to enter student information and grades at
                the same time, and the system will calculate the total average of the student's grades.
