                entrance of the door and closes it after he moves away from the door or after entering
                into the door.

                A grading system is a method of evaluating a child’s educational performance solely on
                the basis of points. It will reduce the number of students who are misclassified based on
                their grades. A Grading System allows users to enter student information and grades at
                the same time, and the system will calculate the total average of the students’ grades.
